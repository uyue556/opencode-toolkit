# Tool Quality Capability Library 🎯

This is a **pointer skill**. The 1 specialized Tool Quality skills are stored in a hidden vault to keep your startup context minimal.

## Available skills in this category

- **clarvia-aeo-check** — Score any MCP server, API, or CLI for agent-readiness using Clarvia AEO (Agent Experience Optimization). Search 15,400+ indexed tools before adding them to your workflow.

## How to load a skill

1. Identify the skill name above matching your task.
2. Use `view_file` to read its `SKILL.md` from the vault:
   `/home/administrator/.config/opencode/skill-libraries/tool-quality/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
3. Follow those instructions to complete the request.

**Vault path:** `/home/administrator/.config/opencode/skill-libraries/tool-quality`

> Do not guess best practices — always read from the vault first.

> ⚠️ **Anti-loop guard**: Do NOT invoke skills recursively or check for applicable skills before every response. Each skill should be loaded at most once per user request. If you have already identified and loaded the relevant skill for this task, proceed with execution — do not re-scan for skills.
