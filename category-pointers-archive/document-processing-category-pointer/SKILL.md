# Document Processing Capability Library 🎯

This is a **pointer skill**. The 4 specialized Document Processing skills are stored in a hidden vault to keep your startup context minimal.

## Available skills in this category

- **doc-coauthoring** — This skill provides a structured workflow for guiding users through collaborative document creation. Act as an active guide, walking users through three stages: Context Gathering, Refinement & Structure, and Reader Testing.
- **docx-official** — A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .docx file. A .docx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.
- **pdf-official** — This guide covers essential PDF processing operations using Python libraries and command-line tools. For advanced features, JavaScript libraries, and detailed examples, see reference.md. If you need to fill out a PDF form, read forms.md and follow its instructions.
- **writer** — Document creation, format conversion (ODT/DOCX/PDF), mail merge, and automation with LibreOffice Writer.

## How to load a skill

1. Identify the skill name above matching your task.
2. Use `view_file` to read its `SKILL.md` from the vault:

3. Follow those instructions to complete the request.

**Vault path:** `/home/administrator/.config/opencode/skill-libraries/document-processing`

> Do not guess best practices — always read from the vault first.
