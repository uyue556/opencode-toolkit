## How to load a skill

1. Identify the skill name above matching your task.
2. Use `view_file` to read its `SKILL.md` from the vault:
   `/home/administrator/.config/opencode/skill-libraries/media/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
3. Follow those instructions to complete the request.

**Vault path:** `/home/administrator/.config/opencode/skill-libraries/media`

> Do not guess best practices — always read from the vault first.

If you have already identified and loaded the relevant skill for this task, proceed with execution — do not re-scan for skills.
