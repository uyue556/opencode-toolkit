# Engine Selection

> Pick tools that match the **delivery target**, **interaction model**, and **team
> constraints**. Engines serve the game type — not the reverse.

## Fit questions (ask first)

1. **Platform:** Web, mobile, PC, console, VR?
2. **Primary loop:** Action/physics, turn-based, narrative branch, management/UI, hybrid?
3. **Presentation:** Full-screen canvas, DOM/UI chrome, or both?
4. **Toolchain:** No-build / ESM OK, or bundler + editor OK?
5. **Authoring:** Code-only, or do designers need Twine/Ink/Godot/Unity editors?

## Architecture patterns

| Pattern | When | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Full engine shell | Game *is* the canvas/scene | Phaser, Godot, Unity, Kaplay as app root |
| Renderer + custom logic | Want draw power, own gameplay | PixiJS, Three.js + your systems |
| Hybrid shell + guest | Dense UI/text + occasional skill-checks | DOM/app shell; mount canvas engines in modals/viewports only |
| Narrative runtime | Branching prose is the product | Ink, Twine; host chrome separately |
| Content-as-data | Levels/events authored as packs | JSON/YAML + thin loader; engine optional |

## Web decision tree

```
What type of game?
│
├── Mostly DOM / panels / forms / text UI
│   ├── + small arcade/spatial challenges
│   │     └── Hybrid: custom shell + guest
│   │         Raw Canvas/WebGL -> Kaplay -> Phaser -> PixiJS
│   └── + branching story
│         └── Ink (inkjs) or Twine export -> host in DOM
│
├── Full-screen 2D game
│   ├── Full gameplay features (scenes, physics, input) -> Phaser 4
│   │     (or Kaplay if you want lighter/faster prototype)
│   └── Mostly rendering / custom systems -> PixiJS 8
│         (or Raw Canvas/WebGL if tiny scope)
│
└── Full-screen 3D game
    ├── Full engine / physics / XR -> Babylon.js
    └── Rendering-focused / lighter -> Three.js
```

## Quick comparison (web & common exports)

| Tool | Type | Best for | Watch-outs |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| Raw Canvas / WebGL | 2D/low-level | Tiny games, learning, no framework tax | You own everything |
| Kaplay (ex-Kaboom) | 2D toolkit | Fast prototypes, jam games | Less "full product" structure than Phaser |
| Phaser 4 | 2D engine | Complete 2D features | Heavier; often bundled |
| PixiJS 8 | 2D renderer | Performance, custom game code | Not a full gameplay framework alone |
| Three.js | 3D renderer | Visuals, lightweight 3D | You add gameplay systems |
| Babylon.js | 3D engine | Fuller 3D + XR | Heavier than Three for simple scenes |
| Ink + inkjs | Narrative | Complex branching prose | Weak for real-time multi-entity sims |
| Twine / Twison / TweeJS | Narrative | Educator-friendly branches | Export/host glue; not a physics engine |
| Godot 4 | Full engine | 2D/3D indie, open source | Web export iteration cost |
| Unity | Full engine | Large teams, multi-platform | Heavy for simple web UI games |

Editor-first web shells (**Construct**, **GDevelop**) fit visual prototyping; weaker when you need versioned code-first content pipelines.

## PC/console decision tree

```
What are you building?
│
├── 2D Game
│   ├── Open source important? -> Godot
│   └── Large team/assets? -> Unity
│
├── 3D Game
│   ├── AAA visual quality? -> Unreal
│   ├── Cross-platform priority? -> Unity
│   └── Indie/open source? -> Godot 4
│
└── Specific Needs
    ├── DOTS performance? -> Unity
    ├── Nanite/Lumen? -> Unreal
    └── Lightweight? -> Godot
```

| Factor | Unity 6 | Godot 4 | Unreal 5 |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| 2D | Good | Excellent | Limited |
| 3D | Good | Good | Excellent |
| Learning | Medium | Easy | Hard |
| Cost | Revenue share | Free | 5% after $1M |
| Team | Any | Solo-Medium | Medium-Large |

## Non-web defaults

| Target | Lean toward |
|--------|-------------|
| PC indie / open source | Godot 4 |
| PC large team / multi-platform | Unity |
| Mobile | `platform-mobile.md` (touch, stores, battery) |
| VR/AR | `platform-vr-ar.md` (+ Babylon/Three on web) |

## Anti-patterns

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Choose Unity/Godot for a form-heavy browser tool | Prefer DOM/hybrid |
| Force Ink to run real-time concurrent simulations | Use narrative tools for branches; custom/sim code for clocks & entities |
| Use Phaser as "the whole app" when surrounding UI is HTML | Prefer a hybrid guest viewport |
| Optimize for WebGPU on day one | Ship WebGL; add WebGPU + fallback when needed |
| Choose an engine by hype | Choose by project needs |
